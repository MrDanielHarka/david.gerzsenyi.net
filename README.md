## About me
Hello!
I’m a cartographer based in Budapest, Hungary, specializing in car navigation content at an automotive company since October 2022. My studies and research in Earth sciences attach me to Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE), where I completed my Bachelor’s, Master’s, and recently, my PhD in April 2025.

## Work
### NNG – iGo navigation
**Map Specialist** *(April 2025 – present).* 
Compiling maps for cars while keeping up with the ever-changing data about the Earth  – so drivers can find their way on the roads.

**Content Quality Specialist** *(October 2022 – March 2025).*
Quality assurance of navigation maps and other content with manual and automated testing methods. In the testing team, I learned not just how to spot errors, but also how to communicate them clearly and work together toward a solution.

## Research
My academic work combined cartography with Earth and geoinformation sciences. The main focus of the research was mapping landslides and other geological hazards in the Gerecse Hills. Later, we constructed a numerical landscape evolution model aiming to simulate the incision and widening of small stream valleys along the Danube. Both topics involved analysing various spatial data sources, field work, and code development.
